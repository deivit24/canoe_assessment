### Question 2

I used both javascript and python to solve this question

Open folder and in the command line input:

    node question1.js

The output should be:

    teacher: Open your mouth please.
    David: Who are you my doctor?  '-' 
    doctor: Open your mouth please.
    David: Okay Doc!
    David:'O' AHHHHH
    David: '-'


or 

input:

    python3 question2.py

output should be:

    lawyer :  Open your mouth please.
    David :Who are you my doctor?  '-' 
    =========
    teacher :  Open your mouth please.
    David :Who are you my doctor?  '-'
    =========
    doctor :  Open your mouth please.
    David Okay Doc!
    David : 'o' AAAHHHHH
    David : '-'
